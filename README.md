# Gdis

My scuffed Discord bot UI

Rewritten 2k24 in Angular

## Requirements
- You'll need the backend server Gdis-server https://github.com/SquirrelsMcGee/GDis-server

## Building
*This is what I did, your mileage may vary*

- Use Node Version: `20.14.0`
- Run `npm install` in the main/root folder of the project

## Development
- I recommend vscode, there's some preconfigured launch tasks you can use
- Some Angular, TS, and web dev experience would be useful
- `ng serve` watches for file changes, rebuilds when necessary, hosts a local server to connect to on port `4200`
